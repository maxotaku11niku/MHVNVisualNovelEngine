# MHVN Visual Novel Engine

## A PC-98 Compatible Visual Novel Engine

**The MHVN Visual Novel Engine** is a data-driven visual novel engine for the PC-9800 series. I want to make it a robust enough foundation for authentically retro VNs. In the future, the executable may be ported to modern platforms, and that would be all I have to do to port any VN made with this engine (though it does mean no graphic upgrade).

## What's in this repository?

This repository contains project files for:

- MHVN98, the main PC-98 compatible executable.

- MHVNTEST, a simple test of the executable with some dummy data.

This repository will contain project files for MHVN-specific tools in the future.

## What's NOT in this repository?

- 98i tools (they can be found on another of my repositories).

- PMD (as I did not develop it, go check Masahiro Kajihara's page).

- Any project files for full VNs I may make for this.
