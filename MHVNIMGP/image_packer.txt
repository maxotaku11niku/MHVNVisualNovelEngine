-- * MHVNIMGP usage * --

mhvnimgp -h
mhvnimgp -o [output filename] <options> [filename of image list file]

Takes the contents of the input file, parses them to figure out which images to include, then archives their contents into the output which will be read for linking with MHVNLINK.

Options:

-h             Displays this help.
-o [filename]  Defines the filename of the output file, with extension.
ONE OF THESE FLAGS MUST BE USED, BUT NOT BOTH!:
-b             Set to 'background' mode, suitable for creating background image archives.
-s             Set to 'sprite' mode, suitable for creating sprite image archives.
