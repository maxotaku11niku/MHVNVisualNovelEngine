Opening scene

@s(SCENE_TEST)

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0000
Well, would you look at that, we've got ourselves a good bunch of text in front of us.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0001
This is a test of the @f(sb)@cbMHVN Visual Novel Engine@r(fc) to show what it can do.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0002
Perhaps you'd like a bit of@f(sb) bold text@r(f) in your life.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0003
Maybe some@f(si) italics@r(f) too, if you're good.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0004
I can even put an @f(su)underline@r(f) on this text as well!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0005
@w3@m8Or perhaps you'd like some masked text?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0006
@c0All @c1the @c2wonderful @c3colours @c4of @c5the @c6beautiful @c7rainbow @c8are @c9ready @cafor @cbus @ccto @cdmake @ceuse @cfof!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0007
Well that's all for now, @p0.
@f(sbi)@ca@d5Have a great day!@]

(none)
@[SCENE_TEST_0008
Suddenly, someone new appears.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0009
Wait, wait, wait, this runs on a PC-98?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000A
Well, it appears that, indeed, it does.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000B
Well, that's @f(si)completely unsurprising!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000C
@f(sb)Of course you're not surprised!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D
What do you think, @p0? Is it surprising?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000E
Anyway, I hope you've gotten over your confusion now.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000F
Hey you @p0! Who do you think's better?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0001_0
You@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0001_1
The Narrator@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0010
Anyway we must press on. Questions with only two answers will get us nowhere. We need to give @p0 more. What's 9 + 10?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0002_0
19, obviously@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0002_1
TWENNY WAN!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0002_2
Uh, what?@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0011
Alright let's take this even further! Which console is the best, in your objective opinion?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0003_0
Nintendo Switch@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0003_1
Playstation@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0003_2
Xbox@]

@[SCENE_TEST_CHOICE_0003_3
None, PC beats them all@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0012
Anyway, I'll come back when we have some actual sprites, instead of just this silly text box and cheesy background.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0013
Yes, well we'll just have to wait for the developer to get to it, then.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0014
So come on developer! Can't you program more for us? Jesus.@]



I've put these ones out of order to test the linker



Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_YES_0
Well what do you know, @p0 certainly seems to think it @f(si)is@r(f) surprising.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_YES_1
Well then they're @c5wrong!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_NO_0
Well, well, well, looks like @p0 agrees with you.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_NO_1
Hah! 2 vs. 1, you're @c5outnumbered!@]



Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000F_CONPER_0
Aww hell yeah @f(si)in your face@r(f) stupid Narrator!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000F_CONPER_1
Well I'm only a narrator, so what can I say.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000F_NARR_0
@f(sbi)What?!@r(f) How could you choose them?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000F_NARR_1
Well, I'm flattered. @c3uwu.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000F_NARR_2
What do you mean '@c3uwu@r(c)'?@]



Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0010_CORRECT
Correct. That should've been straightforward.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0010_MEME
That meme is @f(si)soooooooooo@r(f) dead.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0010_CONFUSED
*sigh* @m8this should be simple@r(m)@d5 Anyway, let me repeat: what's 9 + 10?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0010_FYOU
Fine, if you don't want to cooperate, I guess we should just end this test right here. F*** you. Seriously.@] Bowdlerised since this is a public test



Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0011_NINTENDO
@c5Ooh, fun.@r(c) You must like their exclusives.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0011_PLAYSTATION
@cdOoh, nice.@r(c) They really have a simple naming convention don't they?@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0011_XBOX
@c9Ooh, cool.@r(c) I think the X in DirectX and Xbox are related, right?@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0011_PC_0
@cb@f(sbiu)BASED!!!! PC MAST-@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0011_PC_1
Ahem, can you try not to say anything too offensive?@]
