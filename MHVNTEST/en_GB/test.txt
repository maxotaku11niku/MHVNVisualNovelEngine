@[SCENE_TEST_0000
Well, would you look at that, we've got ourselves a good bunch of text in front of us.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0001
Believe it or not, we can change the @c6colour@r(c) of the text!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0002
Or perhaps you'd like a bit of@f(sb) bold text@r(f) in your life.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0003
Maybe some@f(si) italics@r(f) too, if you're good.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0004
I can even put an @f(su)underline@r(f) on this text as well!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0005
@w3@m8Or perhaps you'd like some masked text?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0006
@t1I wonder if you can tell what's different about this text?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0007
Well that's all for now, @p0.
@f(sbi)@ca@d5Have a great day!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0008
Suddenly, someone new appears.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0009
Wait, wait, wait, this runs on a PC-98?@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000A
Well, it appears that, indeed, it does.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000B
Well, that's @f(si)completely unsurprising!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000C
@f(sb)Of course you're not surprised!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000D
Ah well, I'll come back when we have some actual graphics, instead of nothing at all.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000E
Yes, well we'll just have to wait for the developer to get to it, then.@]

@[SCENE_TEST_000F
So come on developer! Can't you program more for us? Jesus.@]
