@[SCENE_TEST_0000
Well, would you look at that, we've got ourselves a good bunch of text in front of us.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0001
Believe it or not, we can change the @c6colour@r(c) of the text!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0002
Or perhaps you'd like a bit of@f(sb) bold text@r(f) in your life.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0003
Maybe some@f(si) italics@r(f) too, if you're good.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0004
I can even put an @f(su)underline@r(f) on this text as well!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0005
@w3@m8Or perhaps you'd like some masked text?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0006
@t1I wonder if you can tell what's different about this text?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0007
Well that's all for now, @p0.
@f(sbi)@ca@d5Have a great day!@]

@[SCENE_TEST_0008
Suddenly, someone new appears.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_0009
Wait, wait, wait, this runs on a PC-98?@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000A
Well, it appears that, indeed, it does.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000B
Well, that's @f(si)completely unsurprising!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000C
@f(sb)Of course you're not surprised!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D
What do you think, @p0? Is it surprising?@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000E
Ah well, I'll come back when we have some actual graphics, instead of nothing at all.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000F
Yes, well we'll just have to wait for the developer to get to it, then.@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_0010
So come on developer! Can't you program more for us? Jesus.@]

I've put these ones out of order to test the linker

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_YES_0
Well what do you know, @p0 certainly seems to think it @f(si)is@r(f) surprising.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_YES_1
Well then they're @c5wrong!@]

Narrator
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_NO_0
Well, well, well, looks like @p0 agrees with you.@]

Confused Person
@[SCENE_TEST_000D_NO_1
Hah! 2 vs. 1, you're @c5outnumbered!@]
